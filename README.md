## Capstone_2 Proposal


### Citi Bikes

Citi Bike is a successfull docked bikeshare program in NYC.

Data:\
[Citi Bike Trip Histories](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html)  - monthly data reports from 2013 to present\
[Monthly Operating Reports](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data/operating-reports) - city reporting summarizing monthly operations\
[GBFS!](http://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/gbfs.json) - Citi Bike's Real-time API in GBFS specification

Goals:
- Perform EDA on Citi Bike Trip Histories
- Connect to GBFS API for vehicle status information
- Measure relationship between distance traveled by unique bike id and maintenance schedule for preventative maintenance model
- Use Citi Bike Trip Histories and Weather data for predicted demand

Context: I'm interested in predictive geospatial modeling and have a lot of experience in shared-mobility. I think [this company](https://www.zoba.com/) is really cool. Demand was never the problem (sorry Zoba). It was theft and the logistical challenges of managing large fleets of free-floating vehicles. I would like to apply my industry knowledge to improve the operational capabilities of shared-mobility vendors. Could be a cool capstone 3?

### US Election Tweets

1.7M tweets from October to November 2020.

Data:
[US Election Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets)

Goals:
- Apply NLP to both #donaldtrump and #joebiden tweets
- Provide insight on how hashtags are used through sentiment analysis and vote counts
- Perform NMF and topic modeling

Context: The book [Everybody Lies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28512671-everybody-lies) had a big impact on me and I'd love to apply my learnings towards analyzing google searches relating to public health (e.g. who's searching for 'cough' during COVID) and psychology. Not sure how I'd apply this to Capstone 3.

### Rainforest Connection Species Audio Detection

Automate the detection of bird and frog species in a tropical soundscape

Data:
[Rainforest Audio Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rfcx-species-audio-detection/data)

Goals:
- Predict the species given their recording

Context: I love music and Spotify has a big office in LA. My gf is also a musician. I would like to apply my learnings to develop a tool that synthesizes humming into tabs or sheet music.
